# Bare

Bare minimal responsive css grid

# Install

```shell
$ bower install bare
```

# WHY

* Because we wanted a stripped css grid without the bloated css framework.
* Because we love old css grids naming.

# Features

* no javascript
* no reset (you need to use anything you prefer)
* no gutter (you can define)
* small code base
* support all modern browsers down to IE7 & maybe IE6

# Caveats

bare doesn't include a css reset by default, so you need to add one your self, we recommend normalize.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/normalize/3.0.1/normalize.min.css">
```
